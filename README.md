# Arduino-Snake-Game
This project plays the Snake game using Arduino UNO and 8x8 Dot Matrix.  
With Joystick, you can control the snake and hear sound effects with Buzzer.

## Materials Used
- Arduino Uno
- 8x8 Dot Matrix
- joystick
- Buzzer
- Jumper cables

## Setup
1. Open the `snake_game.ino` file with Arduino IDE.
2. Make the following pin links:
   - Dot matrix → DIN = 12 CS = 10 CLK = 11
