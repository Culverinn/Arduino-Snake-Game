# Arduino-Snake-Game
This project plays the Snake game using Arduino UNO and 8x8 Dot Matrix.  
With Joystick, you can control the snake and hear sound effects with Buzzer.

This project was built for learning purposes.
I developed the logic of the code by working with chatgpt.

## Materials Used
- Arduino Uno
- 8x8 Dot Matrix
- joystick
- Buzzer
- Jumper cables

## Setup
1. Open the `snake_game.ino` file with Arduino IDE.
2. Make the following pin links:
   - Dot matrix → DIN = 12 CS = 10 CLK = 11
   - Joystick X → A0
   - Joystick Y → A1
   - Buzzer → 3
3. Upload the code to Arduino UNO.
